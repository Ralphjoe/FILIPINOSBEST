            <h2>Pan de Sal</h2>
         <img src="images/pandesal.jpg" alt="Pan de Sal" >
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>All-purpose flour: 4 cups (plus extra for dusting)</li>
             <li>Active dry yeast: 2 ¼ teaspoons (1 packet)</li>
             <li>Warm water: 1 cup (about 110°F / 43°C)</li>
             <li>Milk: ½ cup (lukewarm)</li>
             <li>Sugar: ⅓ cup (adjust for sweetness preference)</li>
             <li>Salt: 1 teaspoon</li>
             <li>Butter: ¼ cup (melted and cooled)</li>
             <li>Egg: 1 large</li>
             <li>Breadcrumbs: For coating the rolls</li>
         </ul>
 
         <h3>Instructions</h3>
         <h4>Activate the Yeast:</h4>
         <ol>
             <li>In a small bowl, combine warm water, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy, indicating that the yeast is activated.</li>
         </ol>
         <h4>Prepare the Dough:</h4>
         <ol>
             <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining sugar, salt, melted butter, and the lukewarm milk. Stir well to incorporate the ingredients.</li>
             <li>Add the egg and mix.</li>
             <li>Slowly add 2 cups of the flour into the mixture and stir to combine.</li>
             <li>Add the activated yeast mixture and mix well.</li>
             <li>Gradually add the remaining flour, one cup at a time, while mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Knead the Dough:</h4>
         <ol>
             <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
             <li>If the dough is sticky, you can add a bit more flour, but be careful not to add too much.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Let the Dough Rise:</h4>
         <ol>
             <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 to 1.5 hours or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Shape the Pandesal:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small pieces (about 1.5 to 2 ounces each). Roll each piece into a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Coat each dough ball lightly with breadcrumbs and place them on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Final Rise:</h4>
         <ol>
             <li>Cover the rolls with a clean cloth and let them rise again for about 30 minutes to 1 hour until they double in size.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Bake the Pandesal:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Bake the rolls for about 15-20 minutes, or until they turn golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let the pandesal cool slightly on a wire rack before serving.</li>
        </ol>
